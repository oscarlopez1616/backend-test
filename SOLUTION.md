# MY SOLUTION

##Has been refactored in kotlin using the next architectural patterns
- using DDD with CQRS in the apllication to split command and query operations.  there is no write and read model for the domain layer

- I covered with unit test all use cases in the application layer and I have one basic E2E test to cover the  command cli contoller.

thanks for your time
