# MY SOLUTION

##Has been refactored in kotlin using the next architectural patterns
- using DDD with CQRS in the application to split command and query operations.  there is no write and read model for the domain layer

- I covered with unit test all use cases in the application layer, I have been made also one basic E2E test to cover the  command cli controller.

###How to execute Tests
```bash
./gradlew test
```

###How to execute App
```bash
./gradlew run run --scan
```

thanks for your time
